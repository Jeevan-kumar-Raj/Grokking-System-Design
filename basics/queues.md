Queues
====

- Queues are used to effectively manage requests in a large-scale distributed system, in which different components of the system may need to work in an asynchronous way.
- It is an abstraction between the clientâ€™s request and the actual work performed to service it.
- Queues are implemented on the asynchronious communication protocol. When a client submits a task to a queue they are no longer required to wait for the results
- Queue can provide protection from service outages and failures.
